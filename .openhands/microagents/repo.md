## Project Description

This repository contains the configuration and setup for a Homepage instance, which appears to be a dashboard application for managing and accessing various services and infrastructure components. The project uses Docker for containerization and includes configuration files for services, bookmarks, and settings.

## File Structure Overview

The repository has the following key components:

- `.env`: Environment variables for configuration, including API keys and credentials for various services
- `config/`: Directory containing YAML configuration files:
  - `bookmarks.yaml`: Defines bookmarks categorized by infrastructure components
  - `docker.yaml`: Docker-specific configuration
  - `services.yaml`: Service definitions and configurations
  - `settings.yaml`: User interface and layout settings
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for running the Homepage service
- `.vscode/`: Visual Studio Code configuration files

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if available) and populate with your specific configuration values
   - Set appropriate API keys and credentials in the `.env` file

3. **Start the Service**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - The service should be available at `http://localhost:3000` or the host specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file
